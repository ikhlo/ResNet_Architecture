# Multiple Residual Neural Network Architectures

In this Github repository you will find several residual neural architecture for image classification implemented with Keras API. I tried to make this code in the simplest way to be understood and reusable by anyone who need a quick implementation of any deep convolutionnal neural network. 

For those who have some knowledge and technical skills, you can use it as a starting point and make modifications inside functions to create your own neural network according to your need.

## Implemented architectures

Here are the different neural networks implemented in this repository.

<ul>
